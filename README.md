* Hi! 

We're a platform that helps startups hire developers and dev shops. 

1. We review developers and dev shops in every language and country. View my personal profile as an example: https://rafaeli.io/sella-rafaeli, https://rafaeli.io/rotemx, https://rafaeli.io/search?country=il&lang=ruby
2. We partner with our VIP tier to actively run projects together. (We take a commission on these cuts.) What we suggest to buyers in this case is a 2-week free trial.
